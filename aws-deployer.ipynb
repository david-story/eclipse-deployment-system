    "## Notebook For Eclipse Megamovie Software Deployment ##\n",
    "<i>Written by David Story </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook was written to be an easy-to-use plateform for learning how to interface to AWS with Python to deploy and run software on AWS cloud computing services, particularly using AWS EC2 instances. This Notebook is primarily aimed at teaching students how to distribute software for the Eclipse Megamovie to these EC2 instances in order to create datasets for the Eclipse Megamovie project, as well as related computationally heavy research projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will automate a number of tasks for preparing your AWS EC2 instances and deploying software to those instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a specified amount of instances\n",
    "- Send datasets to those instances\n",
    "- Send processing jobs and parameters to instances\n",
    "- Run jobs\n",
    "- Retrieve and store results\n",
    "___\n",
    "### Information on Provided Files ###\n",
    "This repository contains the following folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - support\n",
    "   - software\n",
    "   - shell\n",
    "   - output\n",
    "   - log \n",
    "   - keys\n",
    "   - instances\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "#### support: ####\n",
    "This folder provides supporting Python files that handle alot of more tedious data parsing, string concatenating, and ssh commands for accessing the AWS servers. There are scripts in this folder that generate shell commands, logs, and instance info in .csv files. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### software: ####\n",
    "The software folder is where you put any software and supporting files that you would like to send to the AWS servers. In this note book you will define a main script that will be run on the servers, and then any files you include in the software folder will also be copied over to the servers along with your main program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### shell: ####\n",
    "This folder holds any shell scripts that are generated by this notebook. Each shell script will be copied to its own unique EC2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### output: ####\n",
    "This folder can store outputs from the servers; however it is currently not in use. Currently this notebook saves all outputs to an AWS S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### log: ####\n",
    "This folder holds logs that are generated by this notebook setting the parameters for the AWS instance creations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### keys: ####\n",
    "This folder contains copies of any SSH keys created by this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### instances: ####\n",
    "This folder contains .csv files that contain information for instances that were generated by this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "This notebook uses Python 3.7.0 and requires the following libraries:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - awscli\n",
    "   - boto3\n",
    "   - paramiko\n",
    "   \n",
    "# Important Note! #\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently no monitoring in this notebook, you should be able to monitor the EC2 instances from the AWS EC2 console. Most importantly, <b><span style=\"color:red\">when you are done running the servers, you need to manually stop or terminate those servers or they will stay up and it will keep charging your AWS account.</span></b> I will soon include a small script you can run that automatically closes all your servers.
