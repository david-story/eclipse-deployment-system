    "### Description\n",
    "This notebook was written to be an easy-to-use plateform for deploying and implementing software to AWS cloud computing services and creating datasets for the Eclipse Megamovie project, as well as related computationally heavy research projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will automate a number of tasks for preparing your AWS EC2 instances and deploying software to those instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a specified amount of instances\n",
    "- Send datasets to those instances\n",
    "- Send processing jobs and parameters to instances\n",
